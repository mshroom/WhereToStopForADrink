# Week report 1

In this first week I have decided my subject, formulated the problems that I want to study and examined which algorithms 
and data structures I could use in my project. Clarifying my first vague ideas required some effort and there are still 
details to decide, but at least the big picture of the project is now defined. I hope it meets the requirements of the course.

I have not yet started programming, but I have set up the repository. Some time has passed since I took the course on 
algorithms, so I have had to go through the material and recall forgotten details. I still need to study more precisely 
the algorithms that I have chosen to use.

The next thing to do is to start coding. I will start with the algorithms, and use existing data structures that can later 
be replaced by my own. At first I will use some fake data, because getting real data from the open data platform requires 
some experiments and it is not essential. The rest of the program is not dependent on the authenticity of the data I use.

Time spent: 10 hours
