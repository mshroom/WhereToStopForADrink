# Implementation document

## Application structure

TODO: UML/Package diagram

The application consists of six packages. The software logic is divided in 3 main packages:

- algorithms
  - Shortest path and shortest route algorithms
- dataStructures
  - Heaps, queues and queueable objects
- control
  - Classes that compare algorithms, generate and save graphs and communicate with web classes

In addition to these, there are 3 more packages:

- ui
  - Contains the text ui
- io
  - IO classes for console and files
- web
  - Classes that generate and send http requests
