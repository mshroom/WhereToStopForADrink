# Week report 5

The major features of my application start to be ready, although there still are details to fix and some improvements to make.
This week I tried to make the ui prettier and more logical to use. I also added some features, like the possibility to print 
the path/route as a list of places instead of just the index numbers. There are still some limitations that I would like to 
remove. For example, the starting place cannot be changed. It would be more fun if the user could choose a default place or 
add their own address as a starting place.

I also did some refactoring and cleaning, trying to make the project easier to examine for other students that might review it. 
I had my own peer review to do as well, which took some time. I have also been updating the testing and implementation documents. 

Next week is the last deadline before the demo, so the most important thing is to make those features and improvements that I want 
to have ready by then. 

Time spent: 12 hours
