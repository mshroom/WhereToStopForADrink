# Week report 2

This week I started programming by creating the first versions of all the major algorithms that I need. I say first versions, 
because there probably still is some work to do if I want to make the algorithms as effective as possible. As well as writing 
the algorithms, I tried to refactor my code and managed to get rid of a lot of copy paste.

In the same time I also created unit tests for all the algorithms. The tests rely on some simple graphs that I created just 
for the purpose. For more extensive tests I also have to get more diverse and complex graphs. I learned that it's not very easy 
to make up good graphs so I definitely need some real data.

The next thing to do is to create my own data structures to replace the existing ones. It would also be nice if my program would 
actually do something so I have to start thinking more about the software logic, user interface etc.
